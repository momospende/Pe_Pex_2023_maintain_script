## 1. Introduction
This documentation provides step-by-step instructions for configuring Microsoft Visual Studio Code for Python scripting. It covers the setup of 
Python development, enabling autocompletion, IntelliSense, and debugging features. Additionally, it explains how to incorporate virtual environments 
for isolated package management and run Python applications within those environments.

## 2. Prerequisites
- Microsoft Visual Studio Code installed on your system.
- Python installed on your system.

## 3. Installation
- Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Install Python by downloading the installer from the official Python website: 
[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## 4. Setting Up Python Development in Visual Studio Code

### 4.1. Installing the Python Extension
- Launch Visual Studio Code.
- Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
- Search for "Python" in the extensions marketplace.
- Click on the "Python" extension offered by Microsoft and click the Install button.
- Wait for the installation to complete and restart Visual Studio Code if prompted.

### 4.2. Setting Up a Python Interpreter
- Open a Python file or create a new one with the `.py` extension.
- If prompted, select a Python interpreter. If no prompt appears, follow the next step.
- Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
- Type "Python: Select Interpreter" and select the desired interpreter from the list.

### 4.3. Enabling Autocompletion and IntelliSense
- Visual Studio Code's Python extension provides automatic IntelliSense and autocompletion for Python code.
- As you start typing Python code, suggestions and completions will automatically appear.

### 4.4. Configuring the Debugger
- Open the Python file you want to debug.
- Place breakpoints in the code by clicking on the left gutter of the editor or pressing `F9`.
- Open the Debug view by clicking on the bug icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+D`).
- Click on the gear icon and choose "Python" from the environment options.
- Click on the green play button to
